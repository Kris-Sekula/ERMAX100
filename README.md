# ERMAX100

A python script included here allows you to control the ERMAX100 EPROM Emulator using python. It replaces the DOS software that came origianlly came with the device and is not compatible with modern computers. You will need Python 3.8 and pyserial library (you can install it with "pip install pyserial".
